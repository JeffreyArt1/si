The assignment is designed to check your coding and problem-solving skills. We suggest you spend a maximum of 4-5 hours on it.

Things we require your code to have:

- Exception handling and logging
- Writing and organizing tests
- Task-based asynchronous programming
- Deployment Process

  **Note:** No UI needed.

## Deliverables

1. Use REST or GraphQL to build the API.
2. Use the Typescript as language.
3. Use any database as data store.
4. Use Microsoft Azure as a cloud provider to deploy, make sure we can play with the API.
5. Setup a CI server to run your tests, we must be able to check all tests passing.

## Nice to have (not required)

1. Use a search engine (Elastic Search or Azure Cognitive Search)
2. Use Azure Functions
3. Dockerize and deploy your application using GitHub Actions
